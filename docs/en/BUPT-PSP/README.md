*"Probability and Stochastic Processes"* is an optional course for students of SCS, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications during their sophomore year. It is essential to data science, deep learning, etc.

In BUPT, textbook of this course is *Probability and Stochastic Processes* written by *Assoc. Prof.* Lihua ZHANG and *Prof.* Qing ZHOU. In most universities, *"Stochastic Processes"* is an independent course, and BUPT is using its own textbook, leading to lack of learning resources. Considering the importance of this course, the author hope to collect solutions of the textbook's assignments, wishing it can help others.

In order to allow users to submit feedback and to improve this document, TeX code for generating this document has been maintained on GitHub repo [itdevwu/BUPT-Probability-and-Stochastic-Processes](https://github.com/itdevwu/BUPT-Probability-and-Stochastic-Processes). Issues and pull requests are welcomed.

## Usage

### Auto Compile

GitHub Actions provides very convenient CI/CD service. It can generate ```.pdf``` file after every new "push" and then automatically create a release with this file as its asset.

You can fetch the latest ```.pdf``` file in[releases](https://github.com/itdevwu/BUPT-Probability-and-Stochastic-Processes/releases/latest).

### Manual Compile

Firstly, you need to clone this repo to your target path.

```
git clone https://github.com/itdevwu/BUPT-Probability-and-Stochastic-Processes.git
```

By using XeLaTeX compiler and CTeX, you can compile this project into ```.pdf``` file.

English version documents for LaTeX & CTeX can be found on [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/)
